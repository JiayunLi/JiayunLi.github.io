I'm a PhD candidate in UCLA [Medical Imaging Informatics group](https://mii.ucla.edu/), advised by [Dr. Corey Arnold](https://www.mii.ucla.edu/people/cwarnold/). My current research focuses on developing semi- and weakly-supervised computer vision models to learn deep representations from terabyte-scale whole slide image datasets, which can be integrated in a multi-modal framework for better characterization of disease changes over time. I have worked on many interesting projects including object detection, semantic segmentation, multiple instance learning and image captioning.
