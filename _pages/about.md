I'm a PhD candidate in UCLA [Medical Imaging Informatics group](https://mii.ucla.edu/), advised by [Dr. Corey Arnold](https://www.mii.ucla.edu/people/cwarnold/). My current research focuses on developing semi- and weakly-supervised computer vision models to learn deep representations from terabyte-scale whole slide image datasets, which can be integrated in a multi-modal framework for better characterization of disease changes over time. I have worked on many interesting projects related to object detection, semantic segmentation, multiple instance learning and image captioning.

I start an internship in the data science group at Ancestry.com. I will be working on developing image
captioning models to "tell stories" for historical photos.

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
